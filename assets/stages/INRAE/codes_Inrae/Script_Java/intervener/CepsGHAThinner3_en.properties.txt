CepsGHAThinner3.name = Thinner with an expected final basal area
CepsGHAThinner3.description = Cuts trees to reach a final basal area, respecting a type (from below or from above)
CepsGHAThinner3.subType = Selective thinning

CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.wrongMinCutG = Error on minimum basal area to be cut
CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.wrongType = Wrong type
CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.wrongFinalG = Wrong expected basal area after intervention
#CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.wrongExpectedMixComposition = Error in Expected relative (percentages) abundances of target species after intervention
CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.sceneG = Basal area of the scene (m2/ha)
CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.minCutG = Minimum basal area to be cut (or no intervention) (m2/ha)
CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.type = Type (from below or from above) [0, 1]
CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.finalG = Expected basal area after intervention (m2/ha or in percentage of the initial basal area, e.g. 32%)
#CepsGHAThinnerDialog3.expectedMixComposition = Expected relative (percentages) abundances of target species after intervention (e.g. AAlb-30, FSyl-65)
