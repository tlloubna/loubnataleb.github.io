# Projects
## SafeWay â€“ Sopra Steria Hackathon, October 2024

Development of a **team web project** to find the **safest routes for pedestrians** based on different user profiles: women, men, disabled people, elderly, etc., using **user feedback** and city data from **Clermont-Ferrand**.  

My role included:  
- Developing **Dijkstra heuristics** to find the **safest and shortest paths** with an **alpha parameter** to balance safety and distance.  
- Creating the **graph structure** for shortest-path calculations.  
- Designing the **first web interface** to collect and store user and city data.  

**Results:**  
- 1st place for **communication**  
- 2nd place for **coding part**
